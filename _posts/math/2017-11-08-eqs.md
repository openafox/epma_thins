excerpt: Looks like I was trying to write out the whole process

I am not entirely sure where this all came from but seems like it may be helpful.

$$\rho z=$$mass thickness $$mg/cm^2$$

$$\phi (\rho z)=$$the depth distribution of electron excited x-rays

$$\delta^{f1} =$$surface film with u elements thickness

$$\delta^{f2} =$$subsurface film(buried layer) with v elements thickness

$$R=K(E_0^n-E_c^n)/\rho$$ -- The X-ray range according to Anderson & Hassler

$$I_{generated}=\rho(\Delta \rho z)\int_0^\infty \phi(\rho z)d(\rho z)$$ -- dz in thickness

approximated to(gaussian function)

$$I_{i,observed}=\gamma_0 \exp[-\alpha^2( \rho z)^2]-(\gamma_0-\phi_0)exp[-\alpha^2(\rho z)^2-\beta\rho z]$$

params derived from random walk

$$\exp(-\chi\rho z)=$$Xray absorption factor

Experimental k-ratio - $$k_{i,exp}=\frac{I_{i,obs}(sp)}{I_{i,obs}(st)}$$	sp-sample, st-standard, obs-observed
treating elements individually and ignoring absorption effects, $$\rho z$$ thickness can be estimated:

$$k_{i,exp}=\frac{\int_{0}^{z_i^{f1}} \phi(\rho z)^{sp} d(\rho z)}{\int_{0}^{\infty} \phi(\rho z)^{st} d(\rho z)}$$

but $$\phi(\rho z)$$ can only be arrived from the main iteration so estimate with:
triangular aprox fig 8.

$$q+\frac{1}{2}\left[q-\left(q \frac{\rho z_i^{f1}}{\rho z_{r,i}}\right)\right]=\frac{1}{2}\left(k_{i,exp}\cdot q\cdot\rho z_{r,i}\right)$$
$$\rightarrow \rho z_i^{f1}=\rho z_{r,i}\left(1-\sqrt{1-k_{i,exp}}\right)$$

$$\rho z_{ri}=$$x-ray generation range for element i, =
$$\rho z_{r}=7.0\left(E_0^{1.65}-E_C^{1.65}\right)\left[\frac{\mu g}{cm^2}\right]$$

$$\delta_0^ {f1}=\sum_1\rho z_i^{f1}$$ for i from 1 to u elements

Need to work through the derivation for a buried layer…

Compositions - $$C_{i,0} = \frac{k_{i,exp}}{\sum k_{i,exp}}$$

thickness estimates -  $$\delta_{m+1}^{f1}=\delta_{m}^{f1}\frac{\sum k_{i,exp}}{\sum k_{i,m}}$$m is iteration

$$I_{i(emitted)}=I_{i(gen)}exp-(\mu/\rho)_{specimen}^{i-energy}(\rho x)$$

$$x=z\csc(\theta)$$

![depth](/resources/img/depth.png)


depth-distribution function, φ(ρz), which is a histogram showing the number of X-rays generated in layers of the specimen, each with a thickness of dz, relative to the number of X-rays the beam would produce in a freestanding layer of the same material of thickness dz.

where, φ(Δρz) is the intensity generated in a freestanding layer of thickness Δρz. The


Value of φ(ρz) at the surface, φ0; the maximum value of φ(ρz), φm; the depth at φm, Rm; and the maximum depth where φ(ρz) is zero, Rx are the parameters used to describe a φ(ρz) distribution. Both Rm and Rx decrease with atomic number (Z) and increase with beam energy (E0). φ0 increases with E0.

## GMRfilm Procedure:

1. Setup
2. Calculate Initial Thicknesses
   1. Surface Film
      $$\delta_{0}^{f1}=\sum_{i}R_i\left(1-\sqrt{1-k_{i,exp}}\right)$$
   2. Subsurface Film (Buried Layer)
      - From the MAS 88 Paper
        $$\delta_{0}^{fn}=\sum_iR_i\sqrt{1-k_{i,exp}-\frac{2\Delta_n}{R}+\frac{\left(\Delta_n\right)^2}{R^2} }^{1/2}$$
      - From GMRfilm
        $$\delta_{0}^{fn}=\sum_iR_i \left(1.0-\sqrt{1-k_{i,exp}-\frac{2\Delta_n}{R}+\frac{\left(\Delta_n\right)^2}{R^2} }\right)-\Delta_n$$

        Where:

        i is the current element in the layer

        $$R_i=7.0(E_{i,0})^{1.65}$$

        $$Delta_n=/sum_{m=1}^{n-1}\delta_0^{fm}$$
        is the  depth of layer n
3. Next?

## Spatial Distribution

depth

lateral spread

spatial resolution

### determined by:

1. Diameter and intensity of impinging beam
2. Size, shape, and density of the specimin
the penetration, deceleration and scatering of e- in the specimin (electron diffusion)***
3. Absorption of X-rays in the specimin
4. effect of secondary radiation by continuos or characteristic X-rays


## Diffusion of electrons

See Schumacher [2.2]

Everhart and Hoff [13.1]
	- total path length cna be represented by (derived from Bethe stopping power [Eq 9.2.2]):
		  - eq 13.1.1
	- for Al-Si for 5-25KeV:  k=4e-6, n=1.75

Cosslett and Tomas [13.2]
  - depth can not be derived directly from Bethe(loss along trajectory) becasue of scattering (not straight path)

## Depth range of X-ray Generation:
need to add critical excitation to the eq 13.1.1

	E-E eq

Castaing [13.3}
	- big old eq
	- similar eq by [12.23]
look closer are derivation from the book on page 419
	- this is the One used in GMRfilm
