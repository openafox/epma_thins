## In Code Format

Citation in the body of the code help to point future contributors to the sources of particular equations. To make this consistent a simple format is used as follows:

[Ref # from this page]p{page #}e{equation #} ex. [1]p54e39

Although some in code citations may not have yet been updated to this format.
