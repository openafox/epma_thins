Currently bethe.py will reproduce plots seen in ref [1]

## Working On:

* Tracing GMRFilm
  - Tracing Standard - related somehow to EPMASTDS
    * Testing Phirzeq
    *  Checking Phirzeq eqs (adding citations)

## Questions and ideas

* make way for element to suggest line if energy is too low...
* what is el.flag?   flags
* what is ff in std and phirhoz

## Other info

There is a variable reference I started to create [here](https://github.com/openafox/epma_thins/blob/master/var_ref.txt).

And a poorly written reference for the OOP [here](https://github.com/openafox/epma_thins/blob/master/OOP_Ref.txt).

###  A number of scripts have yet to be ported to python or are in progress:

* gmrfilm.for - Trace me
* gmrfilm.py
* papfluor.for - not sure if this was done
* charfdta.py
* ftest.py - I think this is worked into the atomic_element class but need to check
* abscoeff.py
* charflr.py
* mulayelm.for
* absionrt.py
* compstd.for - kept to help understand standard
* contflr.for
* differen.for
* papei.for
* papex.for
* papexei.for

### print and maint funcs that are probably not needed

* titl.for
* tripint.for
* printout.for
* listel.for
* fluorprn.for
* dlines.for

All the .dat files are in the repo for ref


### Standard.for is still being ported but may not be needed with the new implementation of epmastds.pyh

* standard.for
* standard.py
* standard.dat




Extra function for error finding in files
* findstraybit.py
