# Contributing Code

I would love your help, either as ideas, documentation, or code.

This project is still being ported to Python 3 and refactored from [gmrfilm](https://github.com/openafox/gmrfilm) (fortran) and needs a fair bit of work.
I have access to and can share most (if not all) of the papers the original code was based on and want to thoroughly comment the code with citations as documented [here](/epma_thins/refs).
I have been trying to follow Python's PEP-8 closely and write really good doc strings.

PR's are great and if you wanted to go at it I am willing to make you a manager.

Current things I am working on and other notes can be found in the [work log]({{site.baseurl}}/info/log).

Thank you!

Austin
